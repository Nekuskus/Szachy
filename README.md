# Szachy
An ftp chess client. 

# License
Before I finish it, it does not have a license added. Only people I directly permit can use this repository, whether to fork it, make a commit or just play the game.

### Future plans
After finishing the base project, the repository will be forked by me twice. The first fork will be an English translation of the game. The second fork will be using API requests instead of FTP. It might get translated to English as well.
